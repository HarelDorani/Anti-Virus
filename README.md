# Anti-Virus
Magshimim first mid semester project, an anti virus for files
this program have two options, a rgular scan or a fast scan
the  rgular scan check for the scan in all the file at once.
the quick scan first check the first 20% of the file, 
if the firus signature does not apear the program will check the last20% of the file,
if the virus not apear there to the program will check in the full file.
this took me a week to program and is  my first big code.
